# D3-Challenge
# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3


I accepted The New York Times generous offer and will start my new role in data visualization. My first assignment requires analyzing current trends that are shaping American lives. To help readers understand my findings I will creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements.

My new editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set used for this assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).
The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."



### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)

![4-scatter](Images/4-scatter.jpg)

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: Be sure to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
